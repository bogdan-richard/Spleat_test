Time spent on: ~ 1 hrs

- Simple 1-activity Android application which downloads the list of Spleat venues from API and display them in a ListView
- No other functions
- Only onCreate lifecycle is handled
- Basic UI
- No image caching
- No error handling on network, location errors, assuming that they are ok
- Idea: get your location, and then get the meta data list of venues, then download image
- Code could be more elegant, safer and could have more functions, tried to keep the 1 hour time goal
